This project is a deep dive into excessive use of D3 for custom charting in a dashboard. Financial data is always fun to play with because there's so much of it floating around the web, especially in the cryptoverse. All the data I've gathered here is from Binance or Coin Market Cap.

It's always interesting to visualize stuff like this because there is just so much data asssociated with this stuff it's almost impossible to make sense of anything. Something like a dashboard with financial data is a perfect combo.
