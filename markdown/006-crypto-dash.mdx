This project is a deep dive into excessive use of financial data provided by the popular cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://binance.com" target="_blank">Binance</a> for custom charting in a dashboard. Financial data is always fun to play with because there's so much of it floating around the web, especially in the cryptoverse. All the data I've integrated in this project is from Binance or <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com">Coin Market Cap</a>.
